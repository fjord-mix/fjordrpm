# Fjord box model repository


About the model...


The repository is organised as follows:

- `run_boxmodel.m` contains different examples for running the model, as well as generating animations and basic figures for  checking the output.
- `example_run_parameters` contains the scripts used for setting up the runs in run_boxmodel.m
- `input_data_examples` contains pre-processed input data for the observation-driven examples. 
    - These were generated using the scripts in [this repository](https://github.com/fjord-mix/model-runs) using data compilation functions from [this repository](https://github.com/fjord-mix/data-collation)
- `plotting_code` contains plotting functions for basic output analysis
- `simulation_code` contains the box model itself
- `test_run_parameters` contains pre-defined run parameters for basic model testing and benchmarking
